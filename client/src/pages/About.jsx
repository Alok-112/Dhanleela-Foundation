      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8 sm:text-xl md:text-2xl">
        Welcome to the heart of <span className="font-bold">Dhanleela Foundation</span>, a beacon of hope and a testament to unwavering compassion. Born from a profound belief in the inherent dignity of all living beings, our journey began with a simple, yet powerful, conviction: **no human or animal should ever endure the agony of hunger.** This core principle guides every action we take, every meal we serve, and every life we touch. We are more than just a non-profit; we are a community-driven movement dedicated to fostering a world where kindness is paramount and basic necessities are accessible to everyone.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8 sm:text-xl md:text-2xl">
        In a world often marked by disparity, the sight of a hungry soul—be it a struggling family or a forgotten street animal—serves as our constant motivation. Dhanleela Foundation stands as a bridge between abundance and scarcity, channeling resources, passion, and tireless effort to those who need it most. Our operations are grounded in a deep understanding of local needs, allowing us to implement solutions that are both effective and sustainable. We believe in empowering communities, one meal and one act of kindness at a time.

      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6 sm:text-xl md:text-2xl">
        <span className="font-bold">Our Mission</span> is clear and actionable: To alleviate hunger and suffering by providing consistent nourishment to street animals and orchestrating impactful food drives for underprivileged communities.

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold text-green-600 mb-6 mt-10 sm:text-4xl">How We Transform Lives: Our Core Programs</h2>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6 sm:text-xl md:text-2xl">
        Our impact resonates through a series of carefully designed programs, each addressing a critical facet of hunger and animal welfare:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8 pl-5 sm:text-xl md:text-2xl">
        <li className="mb-3">
          <span className="font-bold">Daily Animal Feeding Drives:</span> Every morning and evening, our dedicated volunteers hit the streets, carrying nutritious meals for stray dogs, cats, and other animals. We believe that these voiceless beings, often overlooked, deserve our care and protection. These regular feeding sessions not only provide essential sustenance but also allow us to monitor their health and intervene when necessary.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-3">
          <span className="font-bold">Community Food Relief Programs:</span> We organize frequent food distribution events in economically vulnerable areas. Working closely with local community leaders, we identify families and individuals most in need, ensuring that nutritious, wholesome food reaches directly into their hands. This often includes dry rations, fresh produce, and cooked meals, tailored to local dietary preferences.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-3">
          <span className="font-bold">Emergency Hunger Response:</span> During times of crisis—be it natural disasters, economic downturns, or unforeseen hardships—Dhanleela Foundation mobilizes rapidly to provide immediate food aid. Our agile response team ensures that vital supplies reach affected populations swiftly, minimizing suffering during critical periods.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-3">
          <span className="font-bold">Animal Rescue & Rehabilitation Support:</span> Beyond feeding, we collaborate with local animal rescuers and shelters, offering support for medical emergencies, vaccinations, and rehabilitation for injured or sick animals. Our goal is to ensure these animals receive the comprehensive care they need to recover and thrive.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-3">
          <span className="font-bold">Awareness & Advocacy Initiatives:</span> We actively engage in public awareness campaigns to highlight the interconnectedness of human and animal welfare. Through educational workshops, social media outreach, and community events, we strive to inspire greater empathy, responsible pet ownership, and sustainable living practices.
